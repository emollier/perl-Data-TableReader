 - Decoder iterators now have ->row attribute
 - Spreadsheet decoder ->position includes sheet number and now uses
   1-based row number (as originally intended)
 - Results of find_table are stored in table_search_results for better
   inspection and reporting on a failure.  This allows detection messages
   to be associated with a row, and various conflicts to be associated with
   a column (without parsing message text).
 - On a failed find_table, user can inspect the attempts in
   table_search_results->{candidates} and select one to be ->{found}, and
   then proceed to create the iterator.
 - col_map is now a full attribute and can be specified in the constructor.
   find_table starts with the user-supplied value and tries to fill in any
   'undef' values in that array.
 - New settings on_partial_match, on_ambiguous_columns, and modified
   official values of on_unknown_columns.  These provide better control
   over what counts as an error and whether to continue the search.
