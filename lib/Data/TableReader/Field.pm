# ABSTRACT: Field specification for Data::TableReader
# VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class describes aspects of one of the fields you want to find in your spreadsheet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

Required.  Used for the hashref key if you pull records as hashes, and used in diagnostic
messages.

=head2 header

A string or regex describing the column header you want to find in the spreadsheet.
If you specify a regex, it is used directly.  If you specify a string, it becomes the regex
matching any string with the same words (\w+) and non-whitespace (\S+) characters in the same
order, case insensitive, surrounded by any amount of non-alphanumeric garbage (C<[\W_]*>).
When no header is specified, the L</name> is used as a string after first breaking it into
words on underscore or camel-case or numeric boundaries.

This deserves some examples:

  Name           Implied Default Header
  "zipcode"      "zipcode"
  "ZipCode"      "Zip Code"
  "Zip_Code"     "zip Code"
  "zip5"         "zip 5"
  
  Header         Regex                                  Could Match...
  "ZipCode"      /^[\W_]*ZipCode[\W_]*$/i               "zipcode:"
  "zip_code"     /^[\W_]*zip_code[\W_]*$/i              "--ZIP_CODE--"
  "zip code"     /^[\W_]*zip[\W_]*code[\W_]*$/i         "ZIP\nCODE    "
  "zip-code"     /^[\W_]*zip[\W_]*-[\W_]*code[\W_]*$/i  "ZIP-CODE:"
  qr/Zip.*Code/  /Zip.*Code/                            "Post(Zip)Code"

If this default matching doesn't meet your needs or paranoia level, then you should always
specify your own header regexes.

(If your data actually doesn't have any header at all and you want to brazenly assume the
columns match the fields, see reader attribute L<Data::TableReader/header_row_at>)

=head2 required

Whether or not this field must be found in order to detect a table.  Defaults is B<true>.
Note this does B<not> require the field of a row to contain data in order to read a record
from the table; it just requires a column to exist.

=head2 trim

  # remove leading/trailing whitespace
  trim => 1
  
  # remove leading/trailing whitespace but also remove "N/A" and "NULL"
  trim => qr( ^ \s* N/A \s* $ | ^ \s* NULL \s* $ | ^ \s+ | \s+ $ )xi
  
  # custom search/replace in a coderef
  trim => sub { s/[\0-\1F\7F]+/ /g; s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; };

If set to a non-reference, this is treated as a boolean of whether to remove leading and
trailing whitespace.  If set to a coderef, the coderef will be called for each value with
C<$_> set to the current value; it should modify C<$_> as appropriate (return value is ignored).
It can also be set to a regular expression of all the patterns to remove, as per
C<< s/$regexp//g >>.

Default is B<1>, which is equivalent to a regular expression of C<< qr/(^\s+)|(\s+$)/ >>.

=head2 blank

The value to extract when the spreadsheet cell is an empty string or undef.  (after any
processing done by L</trim>)  Default is C<undef>.  Another common value would be C<"">.

=head2 type

A L<Type::Tiny> type (or any object or class with a C<validate> method) or a coderef which
returns a validation error message (undef if it is valid).

  use Types::Standard;
  ...
     type => Maybe[Int]
  
  # or without Type::Tiny
     type => sub { $_[0] =~ /^\w+/? undef : "word-characters only" },

This is an optional feature and there is no default.
The behavior of a validation failure depends on the options to TableReader.

=head2 coerce

If C<type> validation fails, this gives you a second chance at fixing the field.  Set this to
a true value to call C<< $field->type->coerce >> on the value, or set it to a coderef of the
form C<< $coerced_value= $coerce->($value) >>.  Type validation will be attempted a second
time on the coerced value, and if successful it replaces the original value.  If it fails, the
original value remains in the record (and you can handle it how you like in the TableReader
on_validation_failure callback).

If you want to apply a coercion before the first type validation is attempted, you can put that
logic into the L</trim> attribute.

Note that validation/coercion is skipped entirely for blank values

=head2 array

Boolean of whether this field can be found multiple times in one table.  Default is B<false>.
If true, the value of the field will always be an arrayref (even if only one column matched).

=head2 follows

Name (or arrayref of names) of a field which this field must follow, in a first-to-last
ordering of the columns.  This field must occur immediately after the named field(s), or after
another field which also has a C<follows> restriction and follows the named field(s).

The purpose of this attribute is to resolve ambiguous columns.  Suppose you expect columns with
the following headers:

  Father    |          |      |       | Mother    |          |      |      
  FirstName | LastName | Tel. | Email | FirstName | LastName | Tel. | Email

You can use C<qr/Father\nFirstName/> to identify the first column, but after FirstName the rest
are ambiguous.  But, TableReader can figure it out if you say:

  { name => 'father_first', header => qr/Father\nFirstName/ },
  { name => 'father_last',  header => 'LastName', follows => 'father_first' },
  { name => 'father_tel',   header => 'Tel.',     follows => 'father_first' },
  { name => 'father_email', header => 'Email',    follows => 'father_first' },
  ..

and so on.  Note how C<'father_first'> is used for each as the C<follows> name; this way if any
non-required fields (like maybe C<Tel>) are completely removed from the file, TableReader
will still be able to find C<LastName> and C<Email>.

You can also use this to accumulate an array of columns that lack headers:

  Scores |      |       |      |       |       |       | OtherData
  12%    | 35%  | 42%   | 18%  | 65%   | 99%   | 55%   | xyz

  { name => 'scores', array => 1, trim => 1 },
  { name => 'scores', array => 1, trim => 1, header => '', follows => 'scores' },

The second field definition has an empty header, which would normally make it rather ambiguous
and potentially capture blank-header columns that might not be part of the array.  But, because
it must follow a column named 'scores' there's no ambiguity; you get exactly any column
starting from the header C<'Scores'> until a column of any other header.

=head2 follows_list

Convenience accessor for C<< @{ ->follows } >>, useful because C<follows> might only be a
scalar.
